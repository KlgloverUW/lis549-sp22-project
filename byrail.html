        <h1>Park It</h1>
        <p>
            Seattle has nearly 500 public parks. Here are some favorites of mine 
            easily accessible by bus or rail:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Discovery Park has beach, field, and woods. Learn more and sign up on their 
                    <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/discovery-park">site.</a> 
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Volunteer Park was designed by the firm that made New York
                    City's Central and Prospect Parks. Learn more and sign up on their 
                    <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/volunteer_park">site.</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Carkeek Park is filled with giant ferns. Get a preview at

        <h1>Volunteer</h1>
        <p>
            Help make the outdoors accessible to others while enjoying it for 
            yourself. Spend time pulling invasive species of plants, counting birds,
            and maintaining trails by giving time to these organizations:
